# PyOAE
Python tools for analysis of Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement

by Greg Pelletier

Tools and examples for using Python for analysis of Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement, including the following:

- root-finding method to solve for the OAE treatment needed to restore any carbonate system variable (e.g. TA-DIC, CO3--, pH, Î©ar, etc.) to pre-industrial conditions
- calculation of the maximum hypothetical OAE efficiency etamax
- calculation of the maximum hypothetical potential CDR
