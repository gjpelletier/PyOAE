# PyOAE
Python tools for analysis of Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement

by Greg Pelletier

Tools for analysis of Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement, including Jupyter Notebooks for the following examples:

- root-finding method to solve for the OAE treatment needed to restore any carbonate system variable (e.g. TA-DIC, CO3--, pH, Î©ar, etc.) to pre-industrial conditions in the coastal California Current Ecosystem. This notebook can also be used to solve for any other location in the global oceans
- calculation of the maximum hypothetical OAE efficiency etamax in the global oceans
